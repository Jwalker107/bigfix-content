Relays with caches that are too small.
<br/>
All relays should have a cache size larger than:
<?Relevance (if (0<(it / (1024*1024*1024*1024))) then (it / (1024*1024*1024*1024)) as string & " TB" else if (0<(it / (1024*1024*1024))) then (it / (1024*1024*1024)) as string & " GB" else if (0<(it / (1024*1024))) then (it / (1024*1024)) as string & " MB" else if (0<(it / (1024))) then (it / (1024)) as string & " KB" else (it as string & " B")) of  sums of (it as trimmed string as integer) of following texts of positions 1 of (preceding texts of first " " of following texts of firsts "size" of it) of (it & " ") of unique values of ((preceding text of first " url=" of it | it) of preceding texts of firsts " http" of substrings separated by "sha1" of it) whose(it contains "size") of unique values whose(it contains "prefetch" AND it contains "sha1") of (it as lowercase) of action scripts of bes actions whose("Open" = state of it) ?>
, which is the size of the downloads in all open actions.
<br/>
The root and/or top level relays should have a cache size at least double the minimum cache size, and generally 300 GB or larger.
