## Dashboards / Wizards meant to be used in the BigFix console.

### Two options for using these:

- Put the dashboard files in a folder, then load dynamically using the Console's `Load Wizard` option in the Debug Menu.
 - Placing the files in a folder before loading with the console is important, because the console will copy the entire contents of the folder.
- Add the dashboard files to a custom site.
